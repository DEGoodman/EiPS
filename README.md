Exercises in Programming Style, 2nd ed

# Intro
Exercises in Programming Style implements a relatively trivial program (counting word frequencies) in a number of different programming paradigms. See the **map** section below for implementations. The paradigms are as follows:

| program number |             style              |
|:--------------:|:------------------------------:|
|    ---I---     |           Historical           |
|      one       | memory constraints, no idents  |
|      two       |  stacks, heaps, "procedures"   |
|     three      |             Arrays             |

|      six       |            Pipeline            |
|     seven      |           Code Golf            |

|     eight      |           Recursion            |
|      nine      |          Kick Forward          |
|      ten       |            The One             |
|    ---IV---    | Objects & Object Interactions  |

|     twelve     |           Letterbox            |
|    thirteen    |          Closed Maps           |
|    fourteen    |        Abstract Things         |
|    fifteen     |           Hollywood            |
|    sixteen     |         Bulletin Board         |

|   seventeen    |         Introspective          |
|    eighteen    |           Reflective           |
|    nineteen    |            Aspects             |
|     twenty     |            Plugins             |
|    ---VI---    |           Adversity            |
|   twenty-one   |         Constructivist         |
|   twenty-two   |            Tantrum             |

## Map
### python/
I split this repository by language as the book examples are written in Python and, while I wanted to implement some in other languages, Python is also well suited for tasks like NLP.
For the time being, all chapters can be found in the `python/` directory.

### static/
Static files used in the examples. These examples were pulled from the book's github repo located http://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style
