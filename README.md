# EiPS
Exercises in Programming Style, 2nd ed

# Intro
Exercises in Programming Style implements a relatively trivial program (counting word frequencies) in a number of different programming paradigms. See the *map* section below for implementations. The paradigms are as follows:

|program number|style|
|:--------:|:-----------------------------:|
| one      | memory constraints, no idents |
| two      | stacks, heaps, "procedures"   |
| three    | Arrays                        |
| four     | Monolithic                    |
| five     | Cookbook                      |
| six      | Pipeline                      |
| seven    | Code Golf                     |

I split this repository by language as the book examples are written in Python and, while I wanted to implement some in other languages, Python is also well suited for tasks like NLP. Anyways, I have a map below to identify which exercies are in which language.
