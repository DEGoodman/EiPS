Exercises in Programming Style, 2nd ed

# Intro
Exercises in Programming Style implements a relatively trivial program (counting word frequencies) in a number of different programming paradigms. See the *map* section below for implementations. The paradigms are as follows:

|program number|style|
|:------------:|:---------------------------:|
|     one      |   high memory constraints   |
|     two      | stacks, heaps, "procedures" |

I split this repository by language as the book examples are written in Python and, while I wanted to implement some in other languages, Python is also well suited for tasks like NLP. Anyways, I have a map below to identify which exercies are in which language.
