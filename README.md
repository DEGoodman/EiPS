Exercises in Programming Style, 2nd ed

# Intro
Exercises in Programming Style implements a relatively trivial program (counting word frequencies) in a number of different programming paradigms. See the **map** section below for implementations. The paradigms are as follows:

|program number|style|
|:--------:|:-----------------------------:|
| one      | memory constraints, no idents |
| two      | stacks, heaps, "procedures"   |
| three    | Arrays                        |
| four     | Monolithic                    |
| five     | Cookbook                      |
| six      | Pipeline                      |
| seven    | Code Golf                     |
| eight    | Recursion                     |
| nine     | Kick Forward                  |
| ten      | The One                       |
| eleven   | Things                        |
| twelve   | Letterbox                     |
| thirteen | Closed Maps                   |

## Map
### python/
I split this repository by language as the book examples are written in Python and, while I wanted to implement some in other languages, Python is also well suited for tasks like NLP.
For the time being, all chapters can be found in the `python/` directory.

### static/
Static files used in the examples. These examples were pulled from the book's github repo located http://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style
