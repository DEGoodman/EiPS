## Constraints
# - No long jumps.
# - Complexity of Control flow tamed by dividn the large problem into
#   smaller units using procedural abstraction.
# - Procedures may share state in the form of global variables.
# - The larger problem is solved by aolying the procedures, one after the
#   other, that change, or add to, the shared state.
